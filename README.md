## Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive radiogenomics pipeline for predicting overall survival in patients with Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC). The analysis integrates multi-modal data including clinical variables, gene expression profiles, and quantitative imaging features extracted from CT scans to build robust prognostic models.

## Objectives

- Develop and validate prognostic signatures using clinical, genomic, and radiomic data


## Dataset

For this project, we will be using the followin preprocessed data available at Mendeley data repository.[1]
